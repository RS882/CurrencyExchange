# Console Currency Exchange Application in Java

## Project Goal
Develop a console application in Java that allows users to exchange between different currencies and maintains a history of completed exchanges.

## Key Project Requirements

### User Interface
- The application provides a console interface for convenient user input.
- Users enter the amount for exchange, the currency they want to exchange, and the currency they want to acquire.

### Currency Exchange Handling
- Support exchange between multiple predefined types of currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP, etc.).
- The exchange rate can be hardcoded in the code or retrieved from a file.
- After user input, the application calculates and displays the exchange result.

### History of Exchange
- The application keeps a record of all completed exchanges.
- The history includes the date and time of the exchange, the amount, and the types of currencies exchanged.
- Users can view the history of exchanges.

## Additional Features (Advanced Level)

- Clear code structure with well-commented sections.
- Error and exception handling, for example, when users provide incorrect input.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/console-currency-exchange.git
   ```
   Replace `your_username` with your GitHub username.

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
